# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

_This is optional and only needed if you want extra protection for contributions_

By contributing to Syntha, you agree that:

1. **You own the copyright** to your contribution or have permission to contribute it
2. **You grant Syntha** the right to use your contribution under the Apache 2.0 license
3. **Your contribution is original work** and doesn't violate any third-party rights
4. **You understand** that your contribution becomes part of the public repository

This is a simple, non-exclusive license that protects both you and the project.

**Note**: This CLA is not currently required. It's here as a template if the project grows and needs formal contribution agreements.
