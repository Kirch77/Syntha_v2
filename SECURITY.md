## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in Syntha SDK, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT Create a Public Issue

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.

### 2. Contact Us Privately

Instead, please use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature or create a private issue in the repository with the following information:

- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: What could an attacker accomplish by exploiting this vulnerability?
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- **Environment**: Version information and configuration details
- **Proof of Concept**: If available, include a minimal proof of concept

### 3. What to Include

Please include as much of the following information as possible:

```

## Response Timeline

We will acknowledge your report within **48 hours** and provide a more detailed response within **7 days** indicating the next steps in handling your report.

Our typical process:

1. **Acknowledgment** (within 48 hours)
2. **Initial assessment** (within 7 days)
3. **Detailed investigation** (1-2 weeks)
4. **Fix development** (timeline varies based on complexity)
5. **Testing and validation** (1-3 days)
6. **Security release** (coordinated disclosure)

## Disclosure Policy

We follow a **coordinated disclosure** policy:

1. **Private reporting**: Issues are reported privately to our security team
2. **Investigation**: We investigate and develop fixes
3. **Security release**: We release a fix in a security update
4. **Public disclosure**: After the fix is released and users have had time to update, we may publish details about the vulnerability

### Timeline for Public Disclosure

- **Immediate**: If the vulnerability is actively being exploited
- **30 days**: For critical vulnerabilities with available fixes
- **90 days**: For other vulnerabilities with available fixes

## Security Updates

Security updates will be:

- Released as patch versions (e.g., 1.0.1)
- Documented in release notes with severity level
- Announced through our communication channels
- Tagged with security labels in GitHub releases

## Security Best Practices

When using Syntha SDK, please follow these security best practices:

### Input Validation

```python
# Always validate input data
def process_user_data(data):
    if not isinstance(data, dict):
        raise ValueError("Invalid data format")

    # Sanitize and validate fields
    validated_data = {}
    for key, value in data.items():
        if key not in ALLOWED_FIELDS:
            continue
        validated_data[key] = sanitize_value(value)

    return validated_data
```

### Database Security

```python
# Use parameterized queries
mesh = ContextMesh(
    enable_persistence=True,
    db_backend="postgresql",
    connection_string="postgresql://user:pass@localhost/db"
)

# The SDK handles parameterization internally, but be careful with:
# - Connection strings (don't expose credentials)
# - Custom SQL if using raw database access
```

### Access Control

```python
# Use subscriber-based access control
mesh.push("sensitive_data", data, subscribers=["authorized_agent"])

# Don't rely on key names for security
# Use explicit subscriber lists for sensitive data
```

### Environment Security

```python
import os

# Store credentials in environment variables
db_password = os.getenv("DB_PASSWORD")
if not db_password:
    raise ValueError("DB_PASSWORD environment variable required")

# Don't hardcode secrets in your code
mesh = ContextMesh(
    enable_persistence=True,
    connection_string=f"postgresql://user:{db_password}@localhost/db"
)
```

## Vulnerability Categories

We're particularly interested in reports about:

### High Severity

- **SQL Injection**: In persistence layer or custom queries
- **Authentication Bypass**: In multi-agent access controls
- **Remote Code Execution**: Through tool execution or data processing
- **Data Exposure**: Unauthorized access to sensitive context data

### Medium Severity

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: In web interfaces or data serialization
- **Path Traversal**: In file operations or logging
- **Denial of Service**: Resource exhaustion or infinite loops
- **Information Disclosure**: Unintended data leakage

### Lower Severity

- **Timing Attacks**: In authentication or data access
- **Resource Leaks**: Memory leaks or unclosed connections
- **Configuration Issues**: Insecure default settings

## Bug Bounty

Currently, we do not offer a formal bug bounty program. However, we deeply appreciate security researchers who help improve the security of Syntha SDK and will:

- Acknowledge your contribution in release notes
- Add you to our security hall of fame
- Provide a reference letter if requested
- Consider future collaboration opportunities
