## Migration Guides

### Upgrading from 0.1.x to 0.2.x

#### Breaking Changes
- `ContextMesh` constructor parameters changed
- Tool handler API redesigned
- Database backend factory function signature updated

#### Migration Steps
1. Update `ContextMesh` initialization:
   ```python
   # Old (0.1.x)
   mesh = ContextMesh(db_path="data.db")
   
   # New (0.2.x)
   mesh = ContextMesh(
       enable_persistence=True,
       db_backend="sqlite",
       db_path="data.db"
   )
   ```

2. Update tool handler usage:
   ```python
   # Old (0.1.x)
   tools = ToolHandler()
   result = tools.get_context("key")
   
   # New (0.2.x)
   tools = ToolHandler(context_mesh=mesh, agent_name="agent1")
   result = tools.handle_get_context(keys=["key"])
   ```

3. Update database backend creation:
   ```python
   # Old (0.1.x)
   backend = SQLiteBackend("data.db")
   
   # New (0.2.x)
   backend = create_database_backend("sqlite", db_path="data.db")
   ```
